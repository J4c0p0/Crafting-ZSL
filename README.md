## Classifier Crafting: Turn Your ConvNet into a Zero-Shot Learner!

This repository contains the supporting code for my recent pre-print [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11112">link</a>]

At the moment, the code only encompasses zero-shot learning evaluation, allowing the user to automatically download data from Animals with Attribute 2 (<a href="https://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA2/">AWA2</a>) and using the proposed splits from <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/zero-shot-learning/zero-shot-learning-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">The Good, The Bad and the Ugly</a> survey.

The final repository is under construction, and updates are expected in the near future. 

<i>While you wait for them, why don't you  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h46L87xjXx0">tango</a> a bit?</i>

### Prerequisites
```
MATLAB R2020b (AlexNet AddOn installed)
cuda 10.2
28 GB space disk (where to download AWA2, the process is automatically handled by the demo!)
```

A PyTorch version of this repository will be available.
